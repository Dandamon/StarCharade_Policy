# Star Charade Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: June 4, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how Star Charade (“the App”), developed by Brainfrog, handles information from users. Star Charade is designed for all ages and does **not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable user data**. The App does not require accounts, ask for personal information, or track your activity across apps or websites.

## Third-Party Services and Advertising

The App uses Google AdMob SDK to display advertisements. While Star Charade does not use cookies or tracking technologies, **Google AdMob may use cookies or similar technologies for ad delivery, analytics, and reporting**. AdMob may automatically collect device type, advertising identifiers, and general location data (such as country or city). Brainfrog does not access or control the data collected by AdMob.
